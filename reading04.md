To add an image into the page 
you need to use an ('<img>')
element.</br>

src
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site.</br>

alt
This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.</br>

title
You can also use the title
attribute with the ('<img>')element 
to provide additional information 
about the image.
